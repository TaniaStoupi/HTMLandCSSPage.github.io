                        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents 
                        designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. 
                        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
                        such as JavaScript, a programming language.
                        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render 
                        the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
                        and originally included cues for its appearance.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying
                        the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
                        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
                        World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, 
                        including layout, colors, and fonts.

                        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, 
                        alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
                        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines 
                        are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for 
                        non-browser usage is Node.js.
